## Project Overview 
 
woodiesWorkShop is a mobile application developed as part of a task in  The Introduction to Mobile Application(IMAD5112). This application was created using **Kotlin** and **Android Studio**. The app's primary purpose is to provide assisstance to a Carpenter who could use this to select what task he would complete and what he would need.This add would also calculate the cost of the task at hand and and allow the Carpentar to enter a time in hours of how long the task would take him. 
 
## Purpose and Features 
 
### Purpose: 
The main purpose of this app is to allow the user to select a task using the Radio Button and to select what they would use for this task using the checkbox.The user would be have to input an amount of hours based on their task and then click the calculate button below which would calculate the cost in the Textview.The Clear Button would be clicked on and all user input would be cleared.   
 
### Key Features: 
- Start Button: The Start button is featured in the first activity screen  which take the user to the Main/Second Activity screen.
- Textview: There are 3 textviews in this project bu the one i am specifically refering to would be the one on the first screen which displays the name of the app,it is the only function of this textview.  
- Calculate Button: The Calculate Button would take the prices coded under the CheckBoxes and calculatea price based on what  the user has checcked off.
- TvDisplayResult:This textview would display the price from the task that would be compeleted and instead of just showing the price ,i have coded it to display the price and task at hand so if used near customer then they would what the Carpenter would do and how much much he would charge them for it.  
 
These features aim to provide easy access to the app and makes it user friendly but alos easy to use for many ages. 
  
 ## Design Considerations 
 
The design of  **WoodiesWorkShop** was based on the following key considerations: 
 
1. **User friendliness & Simplicity:**
- The layout of the app is straightforward and easy to understand for a wide range of ages.
- Radio buttons and Checkboxes for materials and tasks give the user a flexible choice on what is to be done and what is needed.
2. **Functional flow:**
- The design follows a logical sequence:**Task->Materials->Quantity->Calculate->Result.**
- Results are clearly display in the textview below the calculate button.
3. **BackGround:**
- The wooden fence and greenry as a BackGroundsuggests a woodworking theme reinforcig the nature of the app.
4. **Theme consistency:**
- The green color used in the butttons aligns with the outdoor vibe.
- The two buttons are styled consistently ,which maintains the visual unity.

 
## Challenges and Learnings 
 
During the development of this project, I had encoutered a few challenges: 
 
1. **Challenge 1**: There were no errors in my code however the app would not display in Bluestacks. 
   - **Solution**: I added all used colors into strings and ran the app again ,which later worked.
    
2. **Challenge 2**: My Clear button would not clear the Editext and Checkboxes. 
   - **Solution**: I watched a few youtube videos from other developers to figure out what I was doing wrong and found a solution later on.
 
From these challenges, I learnt that one show carefully read over their code ensuring there are no speling mistakes and to String all work done in the project. 
  

## Future Enhancements 
 
While the current version of the app provides what is needed ,there are certain features that i would enhance in the future:  
 
1. **Feature 1**: I would add a button to take the user back to the first Screen. 
2. **Feature 2**: I would add a third screen so that the  data could stored which could help the user keep up on how many jobs have been done. 
3. **Feature 3**: I would add a button so that the costs from from all jobs saved in the third screen would calculate how much the user has made in a monthly or weekly basis. 
 
These enhancements would improve the appâ€™s usability and make it even more versatile for end-users.
